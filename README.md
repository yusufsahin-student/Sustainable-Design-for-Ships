# Sustainable-Design-for-Ships
A sustainable design for the maritime sector (simplified as 'Sustainable Ship')

As the global population continues to rise, the demand for energy is also steadily increasing. To meet this growing energy need, reliance on traditional fossil fuel sources has intensified, while the appeal of renewable energy sources has been steadily increasing. Renewable energy is energy obtained from natural sources that are replenished on a human timescale. In the 21st century, one of the most widespread renewable energy sources is hydrodynamic energy. This project focuses on addressing the world's dependency on energy resources and sustainability, emphasizing the efficiency of hydrodynamic energies.

Titled "Renewable Energy and Maritime," the project aims to raise awareness about energy conservation and environmental protection while offering a creative approach to using renewable energy sources more efficiently. Our project operates with "Deneyap Kart 1A," one of the locally and nationally developed Deneyap Kart models in our country, providing remote connectivity and control through Wi-Fi technology. The controller board uses the Wi-Fi chip on it to connect to Adafruit IO servers, receiving control data from the interface created on the IO server to manage the system's movement.

Thus, water wheels attached to the sides of ships moving in the water (passenger, commercial, etc.) are exposed to kinetic energy, and through this kinetic energy, the water wheel rotates its own dynamo to generate energy. As a result of this process, energy efficiency is achieved. This solution is both environmentally friendly and economically advantageous, also demonstrating the wide applicability of hydroelectric energy and highlighting the potential of this method.
